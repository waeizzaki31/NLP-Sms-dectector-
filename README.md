SMS Spam Detector üì±‚úâÔ∏è
An efficient Python-based SMS Spam Detector utilizing machine learning to classify messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam). This project employs text preprocessing techniques, feature extraction, and classification algorithms to build a robust model for identifying unsolicited or unwanted messages.

Features:
Dataset: Based on the SMS Spam Collection dataset.
Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization (e.g., Bag of Words, TF-IDF).
Modeling: Trained using algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score ensure performance validation.
Deployment: Ready-to-use script for real-time message classification.
Usage:
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script and input an SMS message to check its classification.
This project showcases a practical application of machine learning in combating spam, improving communication efficiency, and enhancing user experiences.
